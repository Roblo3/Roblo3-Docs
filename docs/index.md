# Roblo3 - AWS SDK for Roblox Lua
Roblo3 is an **unofficial** software (or rather, game) development kit that acts as a wrapper for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) service endpoints. Roblo3 is designed for use by developers on the Roblox platform, and adheres to Roblox limitations as best as possible.

Roblo3 is structured similarly and pays homage to the official AWS Boto3 SDK for Python.

## Key Features
- Automatic generation and signage of HTTP requests to AWS endpoints
- Automatic retry of failed HTTP requests, wherever necessary
- Covers as much as the AWS API as possible, given Roblox programming limitations
