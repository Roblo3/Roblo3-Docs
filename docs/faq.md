# Frequency Asked Questions

??? Question "Why do I keep getting `InvalidSignatureException`s when testing in Studio?"
    This error is most likely occuring because Roblox Studio, when testing on your local machine, uses your machine's current time for `os.time()` responses. 
    
    Since the Roblo3 SDK depends on the time provided by the `os.time()` function, if this function does not return the current Universal Coordinated Time in seconds after January 1, 1970, the generated AWS Signature will not match the confirmation signature generated by AWS on their servers, thus resulting in the SDK erroring with an `InvalidSignatureException`.
    
    If this is the case for you, then you are advised to publish the game to Roblox and test the game there, looking in the Developer Console (press the F9 function key on your keyboard to access this) to see if the response is as expected.

    If you are receiving an `InvalidSignatureException` for a reason other than `os.time()` not returning UTC time, check the error message provided to see if you can remedy it yourself; otherwise, contact [tycoonlover1359](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/tycoonlover1359/summary) either via the Roblox Developer forum or on Discord (@tycoonlover1359#6970), or submit an issue on the [Roblo3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/Roblo3/Roblo3).
